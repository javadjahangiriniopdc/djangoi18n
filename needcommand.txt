The easiest way is to download the precompiled binary installer. Download the "static" flavor of your Operating System (32bit or 64bit) and simple run the installer.

Update the system PATH:

Control Panel > System > Advanced > Environment Variables

In the System variables list, click Path, click Edit and then New. Add C:\Program Files\gettext-iconv\bin value.

To check if it's working, go to cmd, navigate to your project folder and type

"manage makemessages -l de".

You may have to configure the path to store translations. Create a dir named "locale" in your project dir and point to it at settings.py

Also make sure to set the local path in settings.py file:

LOCALE_PATHS = (
    BASE_DIR + 'locale/', )
